/* ════════════════════════════════════
   COMMUNITY EVENT PLATFORM DATA
   Adapted from content/traditions/weekly_schedule.md in the public
   espil77/3rd-Space repository (concept/asset origin; see
   docs/features/community-event-platform.md for full attribution).
   This is a separate, isolated dataset — it is never merged into the
   existing `events` array in data.js, and nothing here is treated as
   WorkJax-verified. Every tradition's verificationStatus is "unverified"
   because the source schedule itself has never been independently
   checked (see that file's "Schedule verified" column, all TBD).
