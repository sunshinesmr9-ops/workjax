# WCAG 2.2 AA Checklist

**Status:** `ASSESSMENT IN PROGRESS` — three items below (marked with real evidence and linked to `docs/accessibility/baseline-audit-2026-07-14.md`) have preliminary automated Lighthouse evidence, limited to the Home page only. Every other item remains `NOT ASSESSED`. This checklist is still a tracking structure, not a completed audit.

**Standard:** WCAG 2.2, Level AA (proposed WorkJax technical target — see `docs/operations/accessibility.md`)
**Formal operator:** `UNASSIGNED`
**Accessibility owner:** `UNASSIGNED`

Do not mark any requirement as passed or failed without documented testing evidence. Every item below is initialized as `NOT ASSESSED`, with `reviewer: UNASSIGNED` and `remediation owner: UNASSIGNED`, until a real test is performed and recorded.

Each item lists: requirement, related WCAG success criterion, applicability to WorkJax, test method, evidence, status, review date, reviewer, remediation owner.
